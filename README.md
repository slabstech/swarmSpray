### Swarm Spray

#### Precision Agriculture : Swarm drone based insecticide spray using Off-the-Shelf components

We propose a Swarm based micro-aerial drone robots, to spray instectides for precision agriculture.

In this approach,
A filled syringe is attached to the underbody of a micro-aerial drone. 
The plunger is activated to spray the liquid using an electo-mechanical actuator.

The target area is set based on the type of plant. Using CV the individual leaf/stalk is identified 
and predetermined quantity is sprayed. 


We intend to solve the below issues.

Usage of insecticide for agriculture has a destructive effect of the soil. 

The existing method of using body-mounted hand-pump based system is inefficient in terms of
* Insecticide quantity used
* Sqaure area of land covered

The ineffieciency is are dependent of the factors below
* Human error
* Wind direction
* Distance between plants
* Height of plants
* Type of plants viz., large leaf, small leaf
* Spray Nozzle

On a conservative method/approach, the insecticide is sprayed ineffectively over an area 
due to human error or field of view. 
The error is could a due to a combination of factors viz.,
* Fatigue
* region of interest as a small dense area, cumbersome to traverse
* Reduced plant to plant coverage due to height of plants
